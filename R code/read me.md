# Spatiotemporal Colorado Potato Beetle (CPB) Modeling

This project investigates the spatiotemporal dynamics of Colorado Potato Beetle (CPB) populations in Wisconsin. By integrating multi-source datasets, we aim to uncover the factors influencing CPB distribution and abundance over time and space, supporting sustainable pest management practices.

## Project Overview

The dataset combines historical (2004–2018) and contemporary (2014–2023) CPB monitoring data from multiple research teams. Key data points include:
	•	Field-level information: Grower identities, field names, geolocations, and stage-specific CPB abundance metrics (adult, larval, and egg mass counts).
	•	Climate data: Sourced from MISTGEO, including precipitation, growing degree days (GDD), and temperature trends.
	•	Crop data: Extracted from the Cropland Data Layer (CDL) to calculate potato planting proportions and intensity.
	•	Potato metrics: Computed for each field over a 5-year span using R-based geospatial analysis.
