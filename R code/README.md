# R Codes

This section contains **R scripts** used for identifying crop types and calculating potato intensity with spatial analysis. The choice of R for these tasks is based on its efficient handling of raster data, supported by specialized packages that outperform Python for certain operations.

## Key Features

**Crop Type Identification**
	•	Crop types are identified using small buffer zones around each field, allowing precise spatial analysis.

**Potato Intensity Calculation**
	•	Potato intensity is computed using a 1500-meter buffer zone, accounting for the spatial movement potential of Colorado Potato Beetles (CPB).
